<TITLE>The Amazing, but Illegal, Spiderman</TITLE>
<TEXT>On live TV yesterday, a seven-year-old girl was dangling and struggling to hold onto a sixth-floor balcony railing — as emergency services had been delayed by a stampede of wild Falcons — only to be rescued by Kirby Stewart, an illegal immigrant, who heroically climbed up the side of the building and brought her safely to ground level.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="0">“Of course we’re grateful,” begins Fatima Burns, your Immigration Chief, as she slams the rule book on your desk. “However, illegal immigration is illegal immigration and we’re a nation of laws. Despite his good deed, I’m afraid that we have no choice but to deport him. Heroic acts will not get you any special privileges.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“My PR senses are tingling!” declares Kim Henderson, your Press Secretary, as he puts a comb through your hair. “We should give this Kirby fellow legal status and an official presentation at your office. One good deed deserves another, so make an exception for him. In fact, why don’t you hand out medals at posh ceremonies for every caring citizen? The press coverage will do you wonders!”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“That brave man saved my daughter!” proclaims Heidi Parkarvarkar, the girl’s mother. “He absolutely must be given legal status. In fact, you should give citizenship to all illegal immigrants that are already here, as this incident proves that they aren’t all ‘bad people’. We should give them all the benefit of the doubt.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="3">“So, these immigrants seem pretty good at climbing then?” posits Zeke Vercingetorix, your Employment Minister. “Why don’t we fast-track their citizenship applications and put them in jobs where climbing is required? There are window-cleaners, glaziers, tree-trimmers, roofers — they should be excellent at those kinds of jobs. Let’s face it, most North Kalandians are scared of heights.”</OPTION>

<TITLE>Plastic, Plastic Everywhere</TITLE>
<TEXT>An unusual alliance of environmental activists and garbagemen have brought to your attention the increasing glut of plastic bags that have been found littering the streets of North Kalandia’s cities.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="0">“These damn bags are everywhere!” shouts angry refuse collector Dixie Breitbart. “They’re in our trees, in our rivers, in our streets, and in our sewer system! Do you know how much extra work we have to do to clean up after slobs who are too lazy to put their trash in a can? Ban these bags completely and fine those stores who refuse to comply! Sure, people may have to remember to bring their own damn bags, but think about the back-breaking labor my fellow garbagemen will avoid! And the environment, of course.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“If you can’t get rid of the bags, you must change the bags!” exclaims Jack Harris, an environmentalist spokesperson wearing a lab coat and a huge grin. “Scientists have developed plastics that break down over time, so it doesn’t matter where they’re dumped. Require that only biodegradable plastic bags can be sold in North Kalandia, and the problem will go away.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“You’re not really going to listen to this nonsense, are you?” says Monica Octavian, CEO of PlastiCorp Industries. “Do you know how much this will hurt the plastic industry? How many people I will need to lay off? How many Kalands I - I mean, North Kalandia - will lose? Our economy needs less environmental regulation, not more! Just say no to limits on our plastic bags, and while you’re at it loosen up environmental laws for corporations in general. We can’t afford to let hippie ideas get in the way of North Kalandia’s bottom line.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="3">“Why should consumers have to worry about bags at all?” asks Waldo van Dyke, owner of an online grocery store. “E-commerce is the way of the future. We need to take the next step and put the entire retail industry online. Think about it! No more bags, no more waiting in line, no more wasted time going to the store for food when your food can come to you. Sure, it’ll cause some unemployment in the short run, but there’ll be plenty of jobs at our warehouses. Everyone who matters should have an internet connection by now and it’s high time we embraced the future.”</OPTION>

<TITLE>Licensing Driving North Kalandians Crazy</TITLE>
<TEXT>Your cousin arrived at your office this afternoon, out of breath and deeply frustrated at having to spend day after day filling out forms, only to wait for six hours in a queue to register for another appointment to receive his 27B/6 form to finalize his registration and legally drive the sweet new ride he bought six weeks ago. You’ve agreed, after some persuasion, to hold a meeting with your Minister of Transportation and other experts to look into streamlining the process.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="0">“It’s very important that we get all this information from drivers,” explains Richard Hopkins, your Minister of Transportation. “We have to make absolutely sure that our roads are safe, that all drivers are properly licensed, and that cars reported stolen are easily identified. If that means a bit of extra paperwork, so be it. Increase our budget for staff and we’ll be able to expedite the registration process.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“I have a radical idea,” announces Yolanda Perez, the CEO of North Kalandia’s largest automobile manufacturer. “Simply license car dealerships to handle these processes for consumers! We can fill out all the necessary insurance paperwork for car owners, and even issue driving permits! The DMV is only slow because it has no competition. If dealerships can compete with one another for the best service, buying and registering a new car won’t be such a frustrating ordeal!”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="3">“Licenses? We don’t need no stinkin’ licenses!” exclaims a scruffy-looking man who took a wrong turn and wandered into your meeting. “Why should the government have any say in who can and can’t drive? Get rid of permits, licenses, traffic cops, borders, barriers, speed limits, road laws, and identification plates, and just let people live their lives!”</OPTION>

<TITLE>Jolly Roger Sighted Off the Port Bow!</TITLE>
<TEXT>The merchant navy of North Kalandia has seen increasing attacks from swashbuckling pirates in recent months, devastating the nation’s foreign trade.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="0">“We should blow them out of the water!” says First Lord Admiral Yui Back. “These waterlogged vagabonds have been plundering our ships for far too long! All our exports from the Information Technology industry are going straight into their hands! It’s downright dangerous for us to let this continue! All we require is some funding for coastal patrol boats, fleet carriers, and nuclear submarines and a free hand to show these freebooters what’s what.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="1">“Hello,” says a grog-swilling, peg-legged scurvy dog entering your office. “I’m Dana Ford, a mighty pirate. I’d like to suggest that instead of wasting all that money on attacking pirates you simply buy them off with barrels of bullion, jewels and Maxtopian gold! There’ll still be pirates around, sure, but as long as everyone’s paid off, they won’t hinder your trade. Not much anyway.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“That’s the second biggest load of bilge I’ve ever seen!” says Captain Grapnel, CFO of Hispaniola Shipping Insurance, LLC. “Shiver me timbers, if these scurvy dogs don’t be cutting into me profit margin! Me comprehensive coverage has to pay out for victims o’ illegality, and of course theft be illegal in this country, bu’ that be giving me an idea - what if we were to have privateers? That is to say, if ye were to make piracy legal but with a quota o’ sorts, like huntin’? That way me and mine can stay in business and ye can get a fine cut o’ th’ booty from licence fees! Savvy?”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="3">“Come now, that’s hardly fair,” argues ‘gentleman pirate’ Taupebeard de Gauche with a bow and flourish. “There is an ancient tradition of actively redistributing wealth on the high seas, and we active redistributors serve an important role in the global economy. You would not keep a family-run bookstore from handing down its business from generation to generation, would you? We simply ask, nay, demand the same right! And get rid of the word ‘pirate’. It’s a slur. We are corsairs - not common sea-faring thugs.”</OPTION>

<TITLE>Where There Isn’t Smoke</TITLE>
<TEXT>Since the smoking ban, tragedy has struck North Kalandia as the most hip bars lack a certain &lt;i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt;, formerly smoke-filled back rooms are disturbingly transparent, and withdrawing smokers are beset with torpor. Oh, who are you kidding: powerful tobacco interests, wheelbarrows full of money in tow, have come to your office begging for the law to change.</TEXT>

<OPTION id="1">“Think of the economic impact of the ban,” begs former Nicotine ‘R Us CEO Clara van Straaten. “Tobacco farmers letting their fields go fallow, convenience store workers closing shop after losing their most lucrative products, advertisement agencies forced to switch to making Saturday morning kids cartoons, and yes, the employees of the tobacco companies sent to the poor house. Why, it’s tragic!” She carefully wipes away a single tear with a check for a million Kalands, and discretely stuffs it into one of your pockets. “The economic stimulus and additional tax revenue of a complete lifting of tobacco restrictions should overcome any paltry health objections.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="2">“Dude, this tax revenue talk has me thinking,” murmurs scruffy looking economics professor Herschel  Connery, who smells distinctly skunky to you. “On the one hand, legalizing tobacco and taxing it to the gills will bring in more revenue. On the other hand, legalizing all drugs and taxing them all to the gills will bring in even more revenue, which will then let you lower income taxes. It’ll be a total economic multiplier effect... or something. Hey, did you know the word ‘hand’ is just the word ‘and’ with an ‘h’ at the beginning? Freaky.”</OPTION>
<OPTION id="4">“Is North Kalandian health really for sale?” asks your personal doctor, stethoscope pressed to your chest. “Are kids growing up with parents who are bed ridden due to emphysema worth a few more Kalands in the coffers of North Kalandia? How about hospital beds full of lung cancer victims? If anything, you should further discourage any renegade smoke-fiends by raising the penalties for getting caught holding or dealing tobacco.”</OPTION>
